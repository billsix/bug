- Ensure that the descriptions of the namespace stuff matches the changes I just made.
- Remove cases where I write "(eval (macroexpand-1..." when just invoking the macro would suffice
- Edit the text of the generalized assignment chapter
- Edit the text of the chapter on computation at compile time
- Mention that explicit calling of eval is bad form in general, as typically macro
  invoking is cleaner.  main.bug.scm, line 2433
- Explain once-only
- Error check the input for macroexpand-1
- In the test for mutate!, test that the index only incremented once
- Determine if macroexpand-1 should be exported
- Add appendix on why lambda literals are important
- Move the description of keyword arguments to the first instance of use, numeric if
- Make chapter of lifting, condense string and symbol chapters.  Also add char->int lifting
- Perhaps save the tests so that the user can query for the tests for a procedure in gsi.
- Change size of page for Lulu's hardcover book and look at spacing of the boxes for tests.
