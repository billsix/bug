- Find TODO's in the text of the book.  Either solve them or move them to this file.
- Rework the namespace code.  I realized that the namespace should reflect the library

  And what's would be the point of making stream#cons when that would override good old cons?
- Remove cases where I write "(eval (macroexpand-1..." when just invoking the macro would suffice
- Edit the text of the generalized assignment chapter
- Edit the text of the chapter on computation at compile time
