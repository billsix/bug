- Ensure that the descriptions of the namespace stuff matches the changes I just made.
- Edit the text of the generalized assignment chapter
- Edit the text of the chapter on computation at compile time
- Mention that explicit calling of eval is bad form in general, as typically macro
  invoking is cleaner.  main.bug.scm, line 2433
- Error check the input for macroexpand-1
- Determine if macroexpand-1 should be exported
- Make chapter of lifting, condense string and symbol chapters.  Also add char->int lifting
- Perhaps save the tests so that the user can query for the tests for a procedure in gsi.
- For all of the potential problems associated with macros, address them for each macro.
   (variable naming/scoping, multiple evaluation, etc)
