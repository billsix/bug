- Ensure that the descriptions of the namespace stuff matches the changes I just made.
- Remove cases where I write "(eval (macroexpand-1..." when just invoking the macro would suffice
- Edit the text of the generalized assignment chapter
- Edit the text of the chapter on computation at compile time
- Mention that explicit calling of eval is bad form in general, as typically macro

- Explain once-only
- Error check the input for macroexpand-1
- In the test for mutate!, test that the index only incremented once
- Determine if macroexpand-1 should be exported
