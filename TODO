- Ensure that the descriptions of the namespace stuff matches the changes I just made.
- Perhaps save the tests so that the user can query for the tests for a procedure in gsi.
- Updated preface, as the definition of permutations does not take unit tests as
  part of the definition
- Search for all references to 'with-tests', and update the documentation.
- export 'unit-test'
- Perhaps export a bug#define and bug#define-macro, so that applications which link
  to libbug can use 'unit-test'
