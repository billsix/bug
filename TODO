- Rework the namespace code.  I realized that the namespace should reflect the library
  from which the code came.  What's the point of making stream-cons namespaced to stream?
  And what's would be the point of making stream#cons when that would override good old cons?
- Remove cases where I write "(eval (macroexpand-1..." when just invoking the macro would suffice
- Edit the text of the generalized assignment chapter
- Edit the text of the chapter on computation at compile time
- Mention that explicit calling of eval is bad form in general, as typically macro
  invoking is cleaner.  main.bug.scm, line 2433
- Explain once-only
- Error check the input for macroexpand-1
- In the test for mutate!, test that the index only incremented once
