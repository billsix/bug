- Make the demo project make a loadable library, so that the user can interact
  with their code via bug-gsi
- Remove copyright from the generated projects
- Make man page for libbug-create-project

- Ensure that the descriptions of the namespace stuff matches the changes I just made.
- Perhaps save the tests so that the user can query for the tests for a procedure in gsi.
