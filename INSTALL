Prerequisites
 - Gambit Scheme, versions 4.8 or greater
 - a C compiler like GCC
 - autoconf, automake, make
 - pkg-config

Building
 Run the following:
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --prefix=$myprefix
   make
   make install

Verified builds on
 - Various Linux distributions
 - OS X


If installed in a non-standard (/usr) location,
pkg-config may be used as follows

  "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$myprefix/lib/pkgconfig/"

  run "pkg-config --cflags libbug" to get the location
  of libbug#.scm, libbug-macros.scm, and libbug.c

  run "pkg-config --libs libbug" to get the base name
  for the shared-library/loadable library.  A ".so"
  needs to be suffixed to the command to get the shared
  library, and a ".o1" needs to be suffixed to get the
  loadable library.
