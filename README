BUG - Bill's Utilities for Gambit-C


BUG provides a concise syntax for lambdas, utilities for general-purpose
computation at compile-time, a compile-time unit test framework, and a
collection of utility functions that Bill finds useful.  Taken together,
these can be used in a "literate programming" style.
